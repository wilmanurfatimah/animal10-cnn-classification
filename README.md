# Animal Image Classification using CNN and Transfer Learning with DenseNet121

This project implements an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with transfer learning via DenseNet121. The model is trained on the Animal-10 dataset, which contains 10 classes of animals. It includes steps for data augmentation, class balancing, model fine-tuning, and performance evaluation. Achieves over 95% validation accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization and effectiveness in real-world image recognition tasks.
